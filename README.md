# Recursion Scheme Talks

Various talks I’ve given on using recursion schemes in FP projects in Haskell and Scala.

This repository will track the changes as this talk develops. Each actual presentation of the talk has a tag associated with the version at that point.

Talks included in this repo:

- [Fix Haskell (by eliminating recursion)](recursion-scheme-talk.org) (2016–01–26)
- [Efficient Nanopass Compilers using Cats and Matryoshka](nanopass-compiler-talk.org) – [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIHRBXM75E) (2016–03–02)
- [Recursion: where FP hits ⊥](recursion-bottom.org) (2016-05-27)
